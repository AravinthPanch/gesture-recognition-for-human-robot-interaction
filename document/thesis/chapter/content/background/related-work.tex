\paragraph*{Glove} Vogler et al. [VM04] recorded arm and hand movement data using “Ascension Technologies” MotionStar 3D tracking system and recorded hand posture information using a “Virtual Technologies” CybergloveTM. Fang et al. [FGZ03, GFZC04] developed a large vocabulary sign recognition systems using two CyberglovesTM and three “Pohelmus” 3SPACE-position trackers. Two trackers were positioned on the wrist of each hand and another positioned on the signers back and were used to collect orientation and position data. The CyberglovesTM collected 18-dimensional hand shape information for each hand. Similarly, Oz et al. [OL07] utilised a CybergloveTM along with a “Flock of Birds” 3-D motion tracker to extract hand posture features. Figure 2.5 shows the CybergloveTM and “Flock of Birds” 3-D motion tracker.
