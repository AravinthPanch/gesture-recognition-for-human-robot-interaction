\chapter{Hand Gesture Recognition for Human-Robot Interaction} \label{ch:solution} To build an effective and easy to use hand gesture recognition system for NAO, various tools and technologies are studied during this thesis. The main challenge is to find a solution that can integrate all essential components into a robust system. However, due to the computational and compatibility limitations of NAO \cite{17}, we have faced problems in implementing few contemplated solutions. Finally, the successful solution in achieving the goal will be discussed in the following section.

\section{Implementation} \label{sec:sol:impl} After analyzing the disadvantages of other experimental designs, the final design was chosen to build an efficient real-time hand gesture recognition for human-robot interaction using skeletal points. Figure \ref{fg:hri:architecture} shows the architecture of the solution that was implemented during this thesis by grouping many components into 4 different modules which serve several purposes. Each module is implemented in different environment as shown in the figure and they communicate with one another to complete the data flow. All these modules use a common configuration file named as \textit{hri.json} that contains information such as port number, host name and log path.
