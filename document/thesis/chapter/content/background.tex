\chapter{Background}

\section{Computer Vision in Robotics} Computer vision is a broad field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions \cite{1}.

Proper vision is the utmost importance for the function of any vision based autonomous robot. Areas of artificial intelligence deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. High-level information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system that is acting as a vision sensor.

In this thesis, we will focus on the hand gesture recognition using computer vision techniques for a humanoid robot named as NAO, as shown in the figure \ref{fig:nao}. NAO is an autonomous, programmable humanoid robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics. The NAO Academics Edition was developed for universities and laboratories for research and education purposes. Table \ref{tb:nao} shows the specification of NAO according to Aldebaran Robotics.
