\chapter{Background} \label{ch:background} Computer vision is a broad field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information in the forms of decisions \cite{7}.

Proper vision is the utmost importance for the function of any vision based autonomous robot. Areas of artificial intelligence deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. High-level information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system that is acting as a vision sensor.

In this thesis, we will focus on building hand gesture recognition system for a humanoid robot name as NAO, with the help of computer vision algorithms to track the skeletal points of human body using depth camera. Following sections clearly studies the key concepts of this thesis.
