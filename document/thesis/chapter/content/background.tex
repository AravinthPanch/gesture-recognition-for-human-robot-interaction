\chapter{Background} \label{ch:background} Areas of artificial intelligence deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. High-level information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system that is acting as a vision sensor.

In this thesis, we will focus on building hand gesture recognition system for a humanoid robot name as NAO, with the help of computer vision algorithms to track the skeletal points of human body using depth camera. Following sections clearly studies the key concepts of this thesis.

\section{Summary} This chapter has discussed the concepts of hand gesture recognition using skeletal points tracking with the help of depth camera. It has also talked about the specifications of Aldebaran NAO. Furthermore, It has discussed the features of the machine learning tool GRT that helps us to carry out the classification and prediction of hand gestures in real time.
