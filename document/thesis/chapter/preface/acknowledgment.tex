\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
It is a pleasure to thank those who made this thesis possible. First of all, I would like to thank deeply my thesis advisor, Dr. Yuan Xu for his continued support throughout my months working on this Master Thesis at DAI Labor.
The biggest thanks have to go to my parents and my wife Natalia. Without their support, encouragement and patience, this thesis would not have been completed. 

I am extremely grateful for the members of the examining committee, especially Prof. Sahin Albayrak, for the constructive comments on this manuscript. Furthermore, I would like to thank my friend Mladen Miljic at Yetu AG for the hardware support for this work.

Finally, i would like to thank my employer Alessio Avellan Borgmeyer of The Jodel Venture GmbH who managed to support my autonomy, and provided me enough financial support and time off from my official working hours, so that i could concentrate on my thesis.
