 @brief This file contains the GestureRecognitionPipeline class.
 
 The GestureRecognitionPipeline is the core module of the Gesture Recognition Toolkit.
 You can use the GestureRecognitionPipeline to link the various GRT modules together, for instace you can link a PreProcessing module to a FeatureExtraction
 module to a Classification module and then to a PostProcessing module.
